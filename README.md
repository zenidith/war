This project is a 'Game of War' - a card game where a player battles a computer for 26 rounds to get the highest level card to get enough points to win the game. In this application, I used a 'Card Deck' API in order to pull card deck information as well as images to display in my HTML. 

CSS
Simple CSS layout. Nothing extra special.

<!-- Then I made sure both left/right slides were height:100% to ensure that they took up all of the slider-container screen real estate as well.

JavaScript
All of the slides and buttons were put into variables to work with in the function. The slideChange function was anonymous and changed the slide up or down if those buttons were pushed.

Happy coding!
